\section{What are Composite Indicators}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Variables}

    Last semester, we learned about {\large{concepts}} and {\large{variables}}.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Concept}: A phenomenon (e.g. poverty, democracy, human development, trust in institutions) we are interested in studying.

        \vspace{0.5cm}

        \item \emph{Variable}: Observable characteristic of a unit (e.g. person, city, country) that operationalises the concept.
    \end{itemize}

}

    \end{center}
}

\frame{
    \frametitle{When one variable is not enough}

    Frequently in social science we are interested in {\large{complex concepts that cannot be operationalised with one variable}}.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    Instead, they likely involve {\large{some combination of variables}}.

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{What is it?}

    \begin{center}
        For example, what is democracy?
    \end{center}

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{What is democracy?}

    {\large{Conceptualisation}}: Dahl (1971) argued that democracy has two core attributes:

    \begin{itemize}

        \item \emph{contestation}: competitive elections to choose leaders,

        \item \emph{participation}: inclusive rules for and rates of participation.

    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    Note: not just elections/no elections or universal suffrage/limited suffrage. So \ldots

}

\frame{

    \begin{center}
        \ldots we need a {\large{composite indicator}} to operationalise Dahl's democracy.

        If we don't have good measures of our concepts, {\large{we can't know how one thing effects another}} (relationships \emph{between} concepts), how characteristics {\large{change over time}}, and {\large{how to improve the social world}}.

\section{Steps for Creating Composite Indicators}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Steps for Building Composite Indicators}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Theoretical framework

        \item Data selection

        \item Address missing data

        \item Multivariate analysis (note: we don't really much this in this course)

        \item Normalisation

        \item Weighting and aggregation

        \item Validation (mostly covered Week 10)

    \end{enumerate}

    {\tiny{Modified from OECD (2008, 20-21)}}

}

\frame{

    \begin{center}
        All of these steps should be {\LARGE{clearly documented in detail}}.
    \end{center}

}

\section{Theoretical Framework}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Conceptualisation}

    \begin{center}
        ``What is {\LARGE{badly defined}} is likely to be {\LARGE{badly measured}}.'' {\tiny{(OECD 2008, 22)}}
    \end{center}

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Defining the concept}

    {\large{Concept definitions should}}:

    \begin{itemize}

        \item be clear and parsimonious,

        \item refer to a theoretical framework,

        \item select a relevant unit of analysis,

        \item link various sub-components and the underlying indicator.

    \end{itemize}

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Sub-components}

    {\large{Sub-components}}:

    \begin{itemize}

        \item should be \emph{statistically independent} of each other,

        \begin{itemize}

            \item Want as few components as possible, don't want to double up. Though can compensate in the weighting stage.

        \end{itemize}

        \vspace{0.5cm}

        \item existing \emph{linkages} between them should be \emph{described theoretically and empirically} as much as possible.

    \end{itemize}

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Conceptualising democracy}

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{figures/democracy_conceptualisation.pdf}
    \end{center}

}


\section{Data Selection}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Data selection}

    A composite indicator is {\large{only as good as its parts}}.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    Data on the indicators' component should be selected based on at least their:

    \begin{itemize}

        \item relevance to the theoretical framework,

        \item analytical soundness,

        \item timeliness,

        \item accessibility.

    \end{itemize}

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Gathering, cleaning, merging}

    \begin{center}
        Gathering, cleaning, and merging the component variables is {\large{not trivial}}.

        \vspace{1cm}

        Has important {\large{substantive implications}} (e.g. error can bias your indicators) and can be {\large{time consuming}}.

        \vspace{1cm}

        So, needs to be well documented and {\large{reproducible}}.
    \end{center}

}

\section{Missing data}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Missing values}

    \begin{center}
        To aggregate your components into a composite indicator you need a {\large{complete data set}}, with {\large{no missing values}}.

        \vspace{0.5cm}

        For example, imagine we are going to make a component indicator with \textt{variable\_1}, \textt{variable\_2}, and \textt{variable\_3}. A complete data set would look like:

    \begin{table}
        \begin{tabular}{l c c c}
            country & variable\_1 & variable\_2 & variable\_3 \\
            \hline
            Algeria & 1 & 10034 & 0 \\
            Cambodia & 0 & 30020 & 0 \\
            Zambia & 0 & 50302 & 1 \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{table}

    \end{center}

}

\frame{

    \frametitle{Missing values}

    \begin{center}
        However, we often (especially when working with country-level data) have missing data on at least some of our variables.

        \vspace{0.5cm}

        For example:

        \begin{table}
            \begin{tabular}{l c c c}
                country & variable\_1 & variable\_2 & variable\_3 \\
                \hline
                Algeria & NA & 10034 & 0 \\
                Cambodia & 0 & 30020 & 0 \\
                Zambia & 0 & NA & 1 \\
                \hline
            \end{tabular}
        \end{table}

    \end{center}

Note: NA in R means missing value.

}

\frame{

    \frametitle{Missing values}

    \begin{center}
        You should always assess {\large{how much}} missing data you have and {\large{consider why}} the data is missing.

    \end{center}

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Why missing}

    Data can be:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Missing at random}: why the variable value is missing has nothing to do with the variable--random.

        \vspace{0.5cm}

        \item \emph{Not missing at random}: the variable value is missing because of some reason related to the variable.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item E.g.: Low income countries don't have the money to pay for enough staff to gather GDP data.
        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Why missing}

    Not missing at random is complex to deal with and requires explicit modeling of the missing process.

    \vspace{1cm}

    We do not cover this modeling process in this course.

    \vspace{1cm}

    However, if you suspect your data is not missing at random, you should discuss this, including the reasons why you believe the data is not missing at random.

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Addressing missing data}

    If you have missing data, to get complete cases you can:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item drop incomplete cases,

        \vspace{0.5cm}

        \item single impute data (e.g. replacing the missing value with the variable's mean/median/mode),

        \vspace{0.5cm}

        \item multiple impute data (not covered in this course).
    \end{itemize}

}

\section{Analysis of the sub-component structure}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Underlying structure}

    \begin{center}
        ``Analysing the {\large{underlying structure}} of the data is still an {\large{art}}.'' {\tiny{(OECD 2008, 25)}}

        \vspace{1cm}

        Understanding the underlying structure is important for informing weighting and aggregation decisions, whether or not to include a variable.

        \vspace{0.5cm}

        Note: important multivariate analysis tools--e.g. principal component analysis, cluster analysis--are {\large{beyond the scope of this class}}.
    \end{center}

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Simple correlation analysis}

    A simple way to examine the relationships between your sub-components is to create a {\large{correlation matrix}}.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    {\large{Correlation}}: a mutual relationship between two variables.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    {\large{Correlation coefficient}}: a number ranging from -1 to 1 calculated to represent the linear correlation between two variables. Usually denoted $r$.
}

\frame{

}

\frame{

    A simple way to examine the relationships between your sub-components is to create a {\large{correlation matrix}}.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    {\large{Correlation}}: a mutual relationship between two variables.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    {\large{Correlation coefficient}}: a number ranging from -1 to 1 calculated to represent the linear correlation between two variables. Usually denoted $r$.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    {\large{Correlation matrix}}: A matrix showing correlations between many variables at once.

        \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{figures/energy_corr.pdf}
    \end{center}

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Rough goal}

    The overall goal is to theoretically understand how the variables are related to each other theoretically and empirically.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    Roughly {\large{balance}}:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item not wanting very highly correlated variables, as these indicate duplication

        \begin{center}
            and
        \end{center}

        \item not wanting very lowly correlated variables, as this indicates they are related to different concepts.
    \end{itemize}

    Note: this is a very rough guide. More sophisticated tools await you in later courses.

}

\section{Normalise variables}

\frame{
    \frametitle{On a level playing field}

    Observable variables are often on {\large{\textbf{different scales}}} as they can have {\large{different measurement units}}.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    For example, \emph{life expectancy at birth} is in years ranging from 0 to $>100$ and \emph{GNI per capita} is in US dollars starting from $>300$.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    Obviously, adding these two variables together would {\large{\textbf{weight GNI more than life expectancy}}}.
}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Some notation}

    Some notation:

    \begin{itemzie}
        \item $x_{u,t}$ observed variable value for unit $u$ (e.g. country) at time $t$ (e.g. year)

        \item $I_{u,t}$ normalised value of the variable value for unit $u$ at time $t$
    \end{itemize}

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Normalising approaches}

    There are many approaches to normalising variables (see OECD 2008, 27-29).

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    Here are two for interval/ratio data \ldots

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Min-Max}

    {\large{Min-Max}} rescales a variable to be between 0 and 1 based on the observed minimum and maximum values.

    \begin{equation}
        I_{u,t} = \frac{x_{u,t} - \mathrm{min}(\mathrm{X})}{\mathrm{max}(\mathrm{X}) - \mathrm{min}(\mathrm{X})}
    \end{equation}

    where $\mathrm{X}$ are all of the observed values of the variable. (For R students: it is a vector of the values.)

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    Note: extreme values can distort the measure and can widen the range of closely spaced values.
}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Z-Score Standardisation}

    {\large{Z-Scores}} create a common scale with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

    \begin{equation}
        I_{u,t} = \frac{x_{u,t} - \mu_{\mathrm{X}}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{X}}}
    \end{equation}

    where $\mathrm{\mu_{\mathrm{X}}}$ is the mean of the variable and $\sigma_{\mathrm{X}}$ is the standard deviation.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    Note: extreme values can have a greater effect on the composite indicator.

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Direction}

    All of the variables that you think have a ``positive'' influence on the underlying concept need to be positive.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    All of the variables that you theoretically think have a ``negative'' influence on the underlying concept should be negative.

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Need to consider variable direction, example}

    For example, if we want to create a measure of environmental un-sustainability with the components: C0$^2$ Emissions, Population Growth, and Alternative Energy Use.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    We would expect:

    \begin{itemize}

        \item More C0$^2$ Emissions $\rightarrow$ less sustainable.

        \item More Population Growth $\rightarrow$ less sustainable.

        \item More Alternative Energy Use $\rightarrow$ more sustainable

    \end{itemize}

    So, we need to reverse the scale of our Alternative Energy Use variable

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Reverse the direction of a variable}

    To reverse the direction of a variable simply subtract each value by the maximum observed value, i.e.:

    \begin{equation}
        I_{u,t} = \mathrm{max}(\mathrm{X}) - x_{u,t}
    \end{equation}

}

\section{Weighting and Aggregation}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Why weight?}

    Once you have your normalised variables ($I_{c,t}$), then you need to consider how to {\large{\textbf{aggregate}}} them.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    Specifically consider:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\large{\textbf{Weighting}}}: how important are each individual variables to the composite?

    \end{itemize}
}

\frame{

    \begin{center}
        ``No uniformly agreed methodology exists to weight individual indicators before aggregating them into a composite indicator.''

        \vspace{1cm}

        But generally, ``what matters more \ldots weighs more.''

        {\tiny{https://composite-indicators.jrc.ec.europa.eu/?q=content/step-6-weighting}}
    \end{center}

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Equal weighting}

    If you simply {\large{\textbf{add all of the variables}}} together, you are implicitly assuming that they have an {\large{\textbf{equal weight}}} of {\large{\textbf{1}}}. E.g.:

    \begin{equation}
        CI_{u,t} = \sum I_{u,t}*1
    \end{equation}

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    Sometimes this makes sense: e.g. economic activity is often measured in the same currency, or if you have no prior knowledge about how important each component is.

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Unequal weighting}

    There are many advanced techniques to determine variable weights (e.g. factor analysis, data envelopment analysis and unobserved components models).

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    In this course we are going to use ``{\large{expert judgement}}'' -- you are the experts and will determine how much each component contributes to the composite indicator.

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Expert judgement weights and linear aggregation}

    Imagine that you have four component variables $X_{1}$, $X_{2}$, $X_{3}$ and $X_{4}$.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    Based on your expert knowledge, you believe that $X_{1}$ is much more important than the other three combined. So you give it a weight of 0.7 and the others 0.1:

    \begin{equation}
        CI_{u,t} = 0.7x_{1u,t} + 0.1x_{2u,t} + 0.1x_{3u,t} + 0.1x_{4u,t}
    \end{equation}

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Threshold aggregation}

    Sometimes the concept we are measuring might be discrete. E.g. you are in a financial crisis or not in a financial crisis.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    So, you might use your expert judgement to set a {\LARGE{threshold}}, a point past which a unit goes from having the characteristic to not having the characteristics.

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Threshold example}

    Laeven and Valencia (2013) determine a country has crossed a {\large{financial crisis threshold}} if:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item There is `signficant distress' in a country's financial system.

            \begin{center}
                \emph{and}
            \end{center}

        \item At least three of six policy responses are used (e.g. bank holidays, bank nationalisations).
    \end{itemize}
}

    \begin{center}

    \end{center}

}

\section{What are we measuring?}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Validity}

    Once you have a composite indicator, your work is {\large{\textbf{far from done}}}.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    You need to conduct numerous tests to determine if your indicator is a {\large{\textbf{valid}}} measure of the concept you are trying to measure.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    We will discuss this more in Week 10.

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Transparency}

    There is likely {\LARGE{no perfect composite indicator}} for any given concept.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    {\LARGE{Transparency}}--conceptualisation, data gathering/cleaning, construction, validation--is crucial for others to be able to {\large{understand}} and {\large{evaluate}} your indicators.
}

\section{Pros and Cons}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Uncertainty}

    We need to remember that our indicators are {\LARGE{\textbf{estimates}}} of what we want to measure.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    We are {\LARGE{\textbf{uncertain}}} about how well our indicators capture reality.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    Uncertainty can be {\large{caused}} by at least:

    \begin{itemize}

        \item Error in our construct (i.e. including or omitting important variables)

        \item Measurement error in our raw data $x_{c,t}$

        \item Error in our weighting/aggregation.

    \end{itemize}

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Ranking}

    Composite indicators are popularly used to {\large{\textbf{rank units}}} (e.g. cities, countries).

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    However, this can be {\LARGE{highly misleading}}.
}

\frame{
    \frametitle{Ranking Example}

    For example, Copelovitch, Gandrud, and Hallerberg (2015) created a measure of financial supervisory transparency.

    \begin{table}
        \caption{Financial Regulatory Transparency Index Ranking (2011)}
        \begin{tabular}{l c}
            Country & Rank \\
            \hline
            Brazil & 1 \\
            United States & 7 \\
            Germany & 23 \\
            France & 25 \\
            Slovak Republic & 48 \\
            UK & 61 \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{table}

}

\frame{
    \frametitle{In this course}

    In this course, we won't be covering more advanced ways to quantify your uncertainty about your composite indicators.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    However, you should be {\large{careful and honest when you compare units by ranking}} their composite scores.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

    {\large{Be honest about what you don't know.}}
